1.8 - the original version
- this version is intended for a 2 kByte ROM, from E000h to E7FFh. The
  executed code is expected from E000h-E7FFh. Due to incomplete address
  decoding, the monitor is mirrored in the range E000h to FFFFh.
- the original source is only changed to make it assemble with the 
  asm6809 (https://www.6809.org.uk/asm6809) and produce identical binary 
  code.
  
1.9 - (2021-04-15)
- The code execution range is moved to F800h,
- The display routine is changed to allow usage of the decimal point,
- The display routine is changed to remove ghosting from the previous
  character segments.
- To make space for the extra code, some branches are changed from 16-
  bit to 8-bit. There are two spare bytes in the 2 kByte space.

1.9  (2021-04-27)
- Reverted the execution address range back to E000h, as it seems to break
  user programs. The twi changed to the display routine and the space
  operation remain.
