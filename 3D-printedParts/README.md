These ate the 3D-printed parts I used for the MicroKit09 construction.
Not all are essential, but these two are:

* keyboardPanel8 - The keyboard switch cover

* keyTop3 - The key tops. 34 of these are needed

These are optional

* microKitKeyboardOverlayFrame2  - A frame to keep the keyboard overlay in place

* tapeFrame3 - A guide to help aligning the DymoTag characters.
